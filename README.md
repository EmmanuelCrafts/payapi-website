# PayAPI Multi-Page Website

This project is a multi-page website built as a **Frontend Mentor challenge**. The goal was to replicate a Figma design as closely as possible across multiple pages and screen sizes. The site includes a Homepage, About page, Pricing page, and Contact page, with a fully responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to practice building a responsive, multi-page website while implementing interactive features such as a mobile side navigation bar and a contact form with validation. A design system with colors, fonts, and spacing was provided to guide development.

## Built With
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript  
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for hosting

## Challenges
1. **Creating the mobile side navigation bar:**  
   Initially overwhelming, I spent a day watching tutorials and reading documentation. On the second day, I built it myself—it was challenging but taught me patience and problem-solving.  

2. **Making the navbar mask responsive:**  
   Fixed widths caused alignment issues across screens. Switching to viewport units solved the problem and reinforced the importance of flexible layouts.

## What I’m Proud Of
- Translating the Figma design into a fully functional website  
- Successfully implementing responsiveness across all pages and screen sizes  
- Improving my understanding of layout, positioning, and interactive UI elements  

---

## What I’ll Do Differently Next Time
- Organize CSS more effectively. Placing all styles in one file made managing them harder. Next time, I’ll structure my styles into sections or use a modular approach to keep things maintainable.
